      <!-- 
        why two scripts?
        src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" is 
        the main react library and react-dom is the library that allows 
        us to render react components to the DOM. Means it acts as bridge
        between react and dom. Dom is the browser api that allows browser
        to render html and css.
