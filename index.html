     Why To write "Not Render in the heading?"
     => when we root.render() function executes, the content in side div root..
     ...gets replaced by the react elements.so if we get heading as "Not Render"..
     ...it means that there was a problem with react render.Ep-03 0.17.0

      <!-- 
        why two scripts?
        src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" is 
        the main react library and react-dom is the library that allows 
        us to render react components to the DOM. Means it acts as bridge
        between react and dom. Dom is the browser api that allows browser
        to render html and css.
